# Chess_Online [In Process]
<br/>

## Description:
&emsp;&emsp; Game of Chess, but allow multiple users to connect to the server and play together. 
<br/><br/>

## How to RUN:  (Game not complete, likely will not function as expected)
&emsp;&emsp; Target CMAKE built location by running the following command from the root directory (will take a while to install SFML):
<br/>
```
    cmake -S . -B <target build directory>
```
<br/>&emsp;&emsp;Go into the build directory, build the game with:
```
    make
```
&emsp;&emsp; Then run the game with the command: 
```
    ./CPP_Chess
```
